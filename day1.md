### First Day

Today was my first day at Epicodus. I learned how to push code to Github and clone a repository into my local files. 

### Favorite Food

My favorite food is sushi, and I could probably eat it for _every_ meal the rest of my life. It's **that** good.   

### Favorite Vacation Spot

My favorite vacation destination is Hawaii, more specifically [Kauai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai). I've only been twice, but it's one of the most breathtaking places I've been to.

# Peter's Favorite food: Pizza

Pizza was first recorded in southern Italy in the 10th century. Since then it has _objectively_ been the best type of food. To find out more about the history of pizza [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza).

## Etymology of the word Pizza
_From Wikipedia:_
> The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the central Italian town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze ("twelve pizzas") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.

> Suggested etymologies include:
>
> * Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy) pitta, a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), "fermented pastry", which in Latin became "picta", or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic πίττα, pitta), "pitch", or pḗtea, "bran" (pētítēs, "bran bread").
> * The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza "clamp", as in modern Italian pinze "pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps". Their origin is from Latin pinsere "to pound, stamp".
> * The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo meaning "mouthful" (related to the English words "bit" and "bite"), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading Lombards.
